1. Cloning vs Copy Constructor the object:
   Clone method and Cloneable interface has been broken, it has many defects. Don't use clone concept. Always go with copy 
   constaructor.
   
   Prefer a method that copies the object
   Foo copyFoo (Foo foo){
  
    Foo f = new Foo();
    //for all properties in FOo
    f.set(foo.get());
    return f;
    
   }
